# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and responsible disclosure process for the Secure Smart Contracts Library. These contracts implement critical security features including encryption, access control, and financial operations that require careful consideration.

## üîí Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configurations
4. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are validated
5. **Economy of Mechanism**: Simple, understandable security mechanisms

### Cryptographic Security

#### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)
- **Curve**: secp256k1 (same as Bitcoin/Ethereum)
- **Symmetric**: XOR-based encryption with derived keys
- **MAC**: keccak256-based message authentication codes
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random ephemeral keys

#### Security Properties
- **Confidentiality**: Data encrypted with recipient's public key
- **Authenticity**: MAC verification prevents data tampering
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys provide session security
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp-based validation windows

### Access Control Security

#### Owner Management
- **Dual-Owner Pattern**: Separation of deployer and final owner roles
- **Two-Phase Transfer**: Prevents accidental ownership loss
- **Immutable Final Owner**: Cannot be changed once set
- **Contract-Only Final Owners**: Prevents EOA control (requires smart contract)

#### Time-Based Security
- **Deployment Windows**: 12-hour backup wallet setup window
- **Decryption Windows**: 24-hour maximum decryption timeframe
- **PIN Validation**: 6-digit PIN with hash-based verification
- **Block Timestamp Dependency**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Subject to miner manipulation within limits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### High-Impact Considerations

1. **Block Timestamp Manipulation**
   - **Risk**: Miners can manipulate timestamps within ~15 seconds
   - **Impact**: May affect time-window validations
   - **Mitigation**: Use reasonable time windows (hours, not seconds)

2. **Owner Centralization** 
   - **Risk**: Single owner has significant control over contracts
   - **Impact**: Could lock/unlock contracts or change critical settings
   - **Mitigation**: Use multi-signature wallets or DAO governance for final owners

3. **PIN Entropy Limitations**
   - **Risk**: 6-digit PINs have only ~20 bits of entropy (1M combinations)
   - **Impact**: Vulnerable to brute force attacks
   - **Mitigation**: PINs are additional verification, not primary security

### Medium-Impact Considerations

4. **Gas Limit Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Complex cryptographic operations may exceed gas limits
   - **Impact**: Functions might fail on networks with low gas limits
   - **Mitigation**: Batch size limits and gas-optimized implementations

5. **Frontrunning Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk**: Public mempool visibility may reveal sensitive operations
   - **Impact**: MEV attacks on time-sensitive operations
   - **Mitigation**: Use private mempools or commit-reveal schemes

6. **Contract Upgrade Limitations**
   - **Risk**: No upgrade mechanisms built into contracts
   - **Impact**: Bug fixes require new deployments and migration
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and formal verification before deployment

### Low-Impact Considerations

7. **Event Log Privacy**
   - **Risk**: All events are publicly visible on blockchain
   - **Impact**: Metadata about operations is revealed
   - **Mitigation**: Use minimal event data, encrypt sensitive parameters

8. **Code Size Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Contract size limits may prevent deployment
   - **Impact**: Feature limitations or deployment failures
   - **Mitigation**: Modular design and library usage

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Deployers

1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - [ ] Audit all contract code thoroughly
   - [ ] Test on testnets extensively
   - [ ] Verify compilation settings and optimizer configuration
   - [ ] Use deterministic builds for verification

2. **Deployment Process**
   - [ ] Use hardware wallets or multi-sig for deployment
   - [ ] Verify contract addresses match expected values
   - [ ] Set up backup wallets within 12-hour window
   - [ ] Document all deployment parameters and addresses

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Verify contract source code on block explorers
   - [ ] Monitor contract interactions for anomalies
   - [ ] Maintain secure key management practices
   - [ ] Plan for emergency response procedures

### For Integrators

1. **Integration Security**
   - [ ] Validate all external contract addresses
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling for failed operations
   - [ ] Use appropriate gas limits for cryptographic operations
   - [ ] Test lock/unlock mechanisms thoroughly

2. **Operational Security**
   - [ ] Monitor for unexpected lock states
   - [ ] Implement proper access controls in your contracts
   - [ ] Use the `notLocked` and `allowInternal` modifiers correctly
   - [ ] Plan for graceful degradation during lock states

### For Users

1. **Key Management**
   - [ ] Store private keys securely (hardware wallets recommended)
   - [ ] Never share PINs or private keys
   - [ ] Use unique PINs that are not easily guessable
   - [ ] Backup keys in secure, offline storage

2. **Transaction Security**
   - [ ] Verify transaction parameters before signing
   - [ ] Use appropriate gas prices to prevent stuck transactions
   - [ ] Monitor for successful transaction completion
   - [ ] Be aware of time-window limitations

## üêõ Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Process

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow this process:

#### 1. **Do NOT** disclose publicly
- Do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Do not discuss on social media or public forums
- Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability

#### 2. **Report Privately**
Send detailed information to our security team:
- **Email**: [Create a private security issue on GitHub]
- **Encrypt**: Use GPG encryption if possible
- **Include**: Detailed description, reproduction steps, potential impact

#### 3. **Information to Include**
- **Vulnerability Type**: Classification (e.g., access control, cryptographic, etc.)

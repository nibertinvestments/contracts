## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-13

### Added
- **EncryptionA Library**: Gas-efficient ECIES encryption with secp256k1
  - XOR-based symmetric encryption with derived keys
  - MAC verification for data integrity
  - 24-hour decryption windows
  - Ephemeral key generation for forward secrecy
  
- **EncryptionManager Contract**: Central encryption/decryption management
  - Dual-owner pattern (mutable deployer + immutable final owner)
  - PIN protection with secure hash storage
  - 12-hour backup wallet setup window
  - Time-locked decryption operations
  - Contract locking/unlocking capabilities
  
- **WorkingLockManager Contract**: Interface locking with security protocols
  - Granular access control with interface-only locks
  - Emergency full lockdown capabilities
  - Gas-optimized storage patterns (uint48 timestamps, inverse boolean logic)
  - Integration with EncryptionManager for full security stack
  
- **LockableContract Base**: Modular locking functionality
  - `notLocked` modifier for external function protection
  - `allowInternal` modifier for internal operations during interface locks
  - Dual-manager integration (interface + full locking)
  - Easy integration pattern for existing contracts
  
- **ReflectionLibrary**: Advanced token reflection rewards system
  - Configurable fee structures (creator, reflection, liquidity, burn)
  - Gas-optimized reflection calculations with precision scaling
  - Batch operations with gas limit protection (max 100 items)
  - Account exclusion management for special addresses
  - Event-driven transparency for all operations
  
### Security Features
- **Cryptographic Security**: ECIES with secp256k1, MAC verification, ephemeral keys
- **Access Control**: Multi-layered owner management with backup systems
- **Time-Based Security**: Deployment windows, decryption timeouts, emergency access
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation with descriptive errors
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient data types, storage patterns, and batch limits

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Comprehensive project overview with architecture and examples
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy, vulnerability disclosure, and best practices
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development guidelines, coding standards, and PR process
- **API.md**: Complete API documentation for all contracts and functions
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Step-by-step deployment guide with troubleshooting
- **LICENSE**: MIT license for open-source usage

### Technical Specifications
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.30 (exact for production contracts)
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient data types and storage patterns
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages for debugging
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency
- **Interface Design**: Clean, well-documented interfaces for integration

## Security Considerations

### Known Limitations
- **Block Timestamp Dependency**: Time-based functions subject to miner manipulation (~15 seconds)
- **Owner Centralization**: Single owner has significant control (mitigated by backup systems)
- **PIN Entropy**: 6-digit PINs provide limited entropy (additional security layer only)
- **No Upgrades**: Contracts are immutable (deploy new versions for updates)

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configurations
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts validated
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Simple, understandable security patterns
